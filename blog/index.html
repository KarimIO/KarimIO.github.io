around me dulled into a quiet whir. I just stared in anguish at his lips. Each movement they made used to make my heart flutter, but in that moment, I simply felt a void growing with every movement. I focused on every tiny hair drawing from the stubble around his mouth. I averted my glance to his eyes, his brows dancing to the tune of apology and sadness.\n\n“Hey, are you listening?”\n\nI shook my head. “Yeah, I’m just… why now? Why after all I’ve put in?”\n\n“I tried to- “\n\n“I’ve done everything you’ve wanted and more. I’ve attended every presentation, birthday, and funeral you had to go to, even if I had work, I've always been there for you. And how often have you been there for me?”\n\nHe fumed in response, “I’ve done plenty for you, what are you trying to say?”\n\n“I let you sleep with me. I’ve met your family. I’ve dedicated so much to you. Just… just fuck off.”\n\nI pushed past him and went to the door. As soon as I went out into the winter winds, my skin chilled, but my blood boiled. Somehow, despite feeling both, I also felt nothing. I focused on walking through campus. I took out my phone and texted my best friend, May. I told her I needed to see her. I wasn’t sad, I was fuming, and I needed someone to be there for me to yell both with and at. I stared, waiting for her response before I got impatient and put my phone away.\n\nI went into the cafeteria, thinking that food would be a good outlet right about now. Despite the lack of people around me at the counter, with no one ahead of me, and no one near me, it still felt like it was crowded. The cashier was talking to the chef beside him. I stared at his lips, waiting for them to stop, waiting for his focus to shift to me. I pulled out my phone from my pocket and stared at it a bit to try and see if May had responded yet. She hadn’t – despite her profile saying she was online. I groaned and messaged her, telling her to fucking answer already. I then put my phone in my pocket, looked at the cashier, and impatiently scolded him, “sorry but I’ve been waiting here for five minutes, can you do your job yet? Or should I find another cashier?”\n\n“I’m sorry - I thought you were on your phone.”\n\n“Never mind, just please pay more attention.”\n\nWhen I got my food, I walked out and picked a seat, annoyed at the overwhelming number of couples in the area. Holding hands. Heads on shoulders. I was going to one empty chair when I noticed a girl a few tables away: May. I hurried up to her, put down my tray quickly, and glared into her eyes. She instantly broke away from her phone, looking up, startled. “Where were you? I needed you.” Her eyes looked worried.\n\nShe looked at me apologetically. “Sorry, I didn’t notice – what’s up?”\n\n“We broke up. After all this fucking time, and all this fucking effort – and worst of all, there was no one there when I needed them.” She looked down, embarrassed.\n\nI started telling her about it all. About the whole thing. And then she started tearing up as she looked up at me.\n\n“Don’t be so upset,” I responded, trying to console her, “I’ll be fine. I just fucking hate him. He-”\n\n“My mom’s in the hospital.”\n\n“What?”\n\nShe replied quietly and briefly, “Yeah.”\n\nI looked at her eyes again. Red. Watery. We sat in silence. And my eyes started matching hers.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I said quietly, almost whispering.\n\n\nA moment later, I got up in silence and just walked out. I felt guilty. Guilty for being mad. Mad at her mom for being hurt. Mad at her for not caring more about my story. Mad at myself for storming out. I needed air. I couldn’t breathe.\n\nI finally reached the gardens. I could have sworn it was raining. I felt the cold air. I felt the droplets on my clothes. But I looked up and saw the sky was clear. I closed my eyes, felt teardrops cool my reddened face, and breathed a long, slow breath, doing my all to calm myself. When I opened my eyes, my breathing stabilized. I noticed the flowerbeds of lilies, daffodils, and jasmines adorning the sides of the pathways. I stared at them for what seemed like an eternity, as the yellows and whites captured me.\n\n“Hey,” a voice shattered my focus, “long time no see!”\n\nI turned to see a familiar face, and replied quietly, “Hi.”\n\n“How’s your semester going?”\n\n“It’s fine. Busy. How have you been?”\n\n“I’m great!” he exclaimed, “Oh, have you met Dina?”\n\n“No,” I smiled, “it’s nice to meet you.”\n\nI saw the way he held her hand. His fingers lightly wrapping around hers. Her arm barely pressed against his. Hardly the way I did, when I tugged on his arm and held him constantly, worried someone would take him. I looked at his eyes and smiled. It has been years since I first explored them. They had instantly captured my attention, leaving me breathless: the light bronze surrounding his pupil. And then, one day, I decided I loathed them. I don’t know how, but it was so stupid. I hated every part of him that I used to love. But today I remembered. They were warm. Friendly. And I hadn’t noticed, but they were soothing me.\n\n“I just wanted to say hi, but I have to walk Dina to class,” he said.\n\nI had just really noticed Dina now. She smiled and recognized the pain I was hiding. I don’t know how I knew, but I did, and I don’t know how she knew, but she did.\n\n“It’s okay, I bet you two want to catch up.” She kissed his cheek. “I’ll see you later on, okay babe?”\n\nShe had such confidence. Not just in herself but in their love. She knew it would be there forever, if she took care of it. And I remembered how I used to be with him. How I used to demand he come over when I was upset. How I used to go over to him when he was busy. When he was depressed. When he needed to be alone. But I needed him more. And I demanded him there, always.\n\n“Are you sure?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah. But let’s meet up some time, the three of us,” she reassured me, smiled and walked off. I guess she had no reason to be worried about me taking him.\n\nA moment of silence passed. A moment that lingered for a while as we watched her walk off. Without turning, I said something I hadn’t told anyone in a long time. Something I had to learn to say more - to my partners, my friends. To the people I’ve hurt.\n\n“I’m sorry.”\n\n\n---\n\n**Author's note:** Special thanks to Sara Shalaby and Maryam Kotb for editing the story, and Merna Ahmed for copyediting.

Two argued that the third cheated, and the last was laughing in a way reminiscent of a donkey. The scorching sun stretched their shadows across the encampment. The Soldier stood alone, his dry lips stuck together from hours of silence, split in the middle where he held his Marlboro. They had been sitting tight for a few days, since the cease-fire had been called, and most soldiers had been enjoying their time off. Not the Soldier. He tapped his foot against the ground, eager to do something.\n\nThe Soldier pushed himself off the wall and picked up the rifle next to him. His black boots crunched against the ground as he walked. He entered the sniper’s den, a small area covered with a tarp at the edge of the base, and put his hand on the shoulder of the other sniper there.\n\n“I’ve got this, Yusuf,” the Soldier said, the ashes from his cigarette falling as he spoke.\n\n“How long’s it been,\" Yusuf asked, breaking into a yawn.\n\n“Around three hours,” \n\nYusuf nodded and rubbed his eyes, “Yeah, I’ll just go get some shut-eye.”\n\nThe Soldier helped Yusuf up by the hand, and swiveled to pushed him out of the den. He mechanically fixed his rifle atop the beige sandbags that gave him cover. Sprawling across the sand-covered wooden planks that made the floor of the den, he put his head against the stock of the rifle and looked through the scope.\n\nHe and Yusuf took shifts watching an old road that passed by the base, linking Kurdish Syria and Turkey. The road had barely been traveled for a month. Cracks ran throughout the asphalt, and it was covered with sand from lack of use. He remembered when he was first deployed, overseeing tanks and armored personnel carriers driving into Kurdistan.\n\nAfter a few hours of staring through the scope, his muscles grew stiff, and so the Soldier rested his eyes and stretched his neck. As he opened his eyes again, he soon found himself gazing at his dozens of tattoos on his arms, he remembered when he got each of them. Tattoos were very rare in Turkey, but he had started getting them at 16, sneaking out of his house to get them with his small sum of savings. His favorite was a cracked skull, with thorny vines twirling around it. As he grew older the quality of the tattoos got better. Most of the tattoos covered swelling lines. There were more lines on his back, where his dad’s belt met his skin. Some were lines on his wrist. Those he claimed as his own. The Soldier’s body was a gallery of pain that he had turned into beauty with his little inked masterpieces.\n\nThen he noticed that tattoo with his mom’s name. Cliché, maybe, but it was important to him nonetheless. She was always there for him. She was there when he won his football matches. She was there for him when he shed his tears. When she wasn’t feigning ignorance of how her husband was beating her son, she iced his wounds and made him feel better.  And now she was there for him on his arm.\n\n---\n\nThe sound of spinning wheels drowned out the sound of music. The Boy was playing with his toys, an action figure and a toy featherless velociraptor, pressing them against each other to act out the fighting. He made sounds to imitate the grunts and groans of his action figures. The screeching of the velociraptor and the groans of the man. \"Take that!\" But he yelled too loudly and disturbed his father at the wheel. The Father spun around and smacked the Boy’s legs, making him yelp out in pain.\n\n“Can you shut up for five minutes! If I hear another peep out of you for the rest of the ride, I’m going to break your windpipe so I can get some damn peace.”\n\nThe Boy stifled his tears, wrapping his arms around his legs to ease the pain. His mother turned in her seat and soothed the Boy’s bruise with her hand.\n\n“Leave him be,” the father said. “if you keep babying him, he’ll never become a real man.”\n\nThe mother quickly faced forwards in obedience. The Boy knew she was just as scared as he was. The Boy’s tears fell onto his bruise, which helped somewhat. Soon, the father pulled over.\n\n“I need a break. From driving, from you, from this fucking life. I get zero gratitude from either of you, and I’m so goddamn tired of it.” He slammed the door, and when he was a clear distance away, the mother turned and gave her son a kiss on the cheek.\n\n“I know he gets angry a lot, but never mind him. You know, he loves you.”\n\n---\n\nThe Soldier had stopped looking at his arms and was now staring into the desert. He shook his head to get some focus and reached for the water bottle next to him. As he drank, he saw dust rising far in the distance. He put down the bottle, seeing a Toyota driving across the road. The Soldier put his eye to his scope and took a closer look. The car came to a halt on the side of the road. He made out three figures inside the car, as one quickly opened the door and got out. It was a man, wearing a beige shirt and khakis. Half a minute later, a woman exited the other side, and stared out into the desert.\n\nThe Soldier stared at the figures for a minute, his hand grasping his rifle. His finger was itching. He hadn’t been in combat for weeks. But now, right there, he finally had a target. A hundred kilometers out, no one would know where the shot came from. Hell, no one would care. The Soldier looked to the ground and thought for a moment, finger tracing the trigger guard. The woman hadn’t moved, but the man was pacing back and forth.\n\nSuddenly, a jolt of energy came to the Soldier. He put his finger on the trigger, aimed at the woman, and fired. He watched her look around for a moment, before she lunged forward and collapsed a second later, when the bullet finally hit. The Soldier grinned. The man in the distance turned to face his wife and swiftly running towards her. The Soldier grinned further as he turned the rifle towards the man and shot. It felt good. The release. The adrenaline. The power he’s wanted for so long.\n\nThe fact he could make that shot filled him with a looming lust for blood. The Soldier stared through the scope at the man crawling towards his motionless wife, leaving behind a trail of blood. The man soon turned onto his back, his body twitching and chest spasming. And then he just stopped. The deed was done.\n\nThe Soldier reached for a cigarette and stared at the bodies through his scope. As he gazed at them, he noticed that the woman was moving strangely. Soon, an arm reached out from beneath her. It was small and skinny. Feebly, a small child pulled himself out from under the woman. The Soldier had no idea the kid was there. His jaw dropped, and his cigarette fell to the ground. The Boy, whose shoulder was bleeding from the hit, dropped to his knees as got out from under her, before turning and pushing his mother to wake. His expression was almost indescernable from this distance, but it was clear he was dazed and confused. The Soldier stared for another minute. He saw the kid looking over at his dad, and begin to pull his mother towards the car. His finger tightened again, and he took the shot. The bullet hit the Boy’s head so hard he flew backwards snapping his neck, besides the giant hole left by the 7.62×51mm round passing cleanly through. The Soldier lifted his head up from the scope. And he smiled. Ear to ear.\n\n---\n\n**Author's note:** Special thanks to Arwa Hezzah and Laila Ghoneim who helped me with editing the article, and Ingie Gohar for the picture!

I\nstepped over cobblestone dotted over bright green grass, surrounded by bushes\nand flowers. I had a copy of *Politics and Society in the Contemporary Middle\nEast* under my arm as I walked briskly; my best friend, Moe, hurried beside me.\nHis arms were waving absurdly as he explored the fascinating book he was\nreading, *The Road*, about a man and his son surviving the post-apocalypse. I\nwas nodding back, enthralled more by the passion with which he spoke than the\nbook itself.\n\nFive minutes later, we finally reached the apartment building, a massive slab of\ngrey concrete with square windows, which was mostly being leased to students. As\nwe approached the ground-floor lobby, I saw a girl with arms folded, leaning\nback against the towering wall. I called out to her name, “Sahar!” She quickly\nswiveled her head towards me and boomed back “Noor!” As I reached her, I gave\nher a big hug and picked her up. She was shorter than me at around a meter sixty\n– and so her curly brown hair tickled my face, which was covered with tiny\nspeckles of paint she must have missed when she washed it. She took a step back\nand looked at Moe again, smiling warmly, before giving him a high five, since\nshe had only known him for a few weeks.\n\n“So, Noor, Moe, what are you two up to!” she asked, a hint of nervousness in her\nvoice as she looked at Moe, who began talking about all the Physics courses he\nhad to work on. Sahar began playing with her own hair and biting her dark red\nlower lip as her green eyes met Moe’s hazel eyes. Moe’s dark up-swept hair\nbounced slightly from its manicured, gelled form as he talked. I looked at him,\nlistening intently, watching his chiseled, stubble-covered jaw move as he\ndiscussed his recent acceptance into the college football team. He looked at me,\nhis thick eyebrows questioning whether I was listening. I nodded, smiling. Moe\ntalked very confidently, and had a very soothing, deep voice. I looked to his\nshoulder and noticed he was clutching his backpack straps tightly in his hand. I\nlooked down further, and realized his foot was tapping nervously. Glancing back\nat Sahar, though, it appeared she hadn’t realized. She was too busy staring at\nhim. She clearly thought he was handsome – like one of the beautiful sunsets she\nlikes to paint – but then again, so was she. Her right hand lay on her left arm,\npressed against her white tank top, which matched nicely with her light blue\njeans, brown belt, and white sneakers.\n\nAfter talking a bit more, we all said our goodbyes and headed our separate ways,\nas we all had to study for midterms. We all lived in separate floors of the\nbuilding, and I went to my own room, set up a bowl of Cheetos and began my work\nas I munched through my cheesy treats.\n\n---\n\nAn hour later, I was still staring at a blank document. The blue glow of the\nscreen filled the otherwise pitch-black room. I had to write about the role of\njournalism in the Middle East’s current society for an assignment, yet I\ncouldn’t focus, and couldn’t write. Frustrated, I slowly pushed myself up from\nthe desk as the chair rolled across the wooden floor, stretched lazily, and\nwalked around the room. Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted my roommate on\nthe couch in a dark corner of the room. Ashraf sat there, listening to music,\nwith arms folded, his thoughts running a million miles a minute. He rested his\nfoot on his red, chipped, and scratched acoustic guitar, which he carried around\neverywhere but hasn’t played in months – I think he mainly liked the look it\ngave him and the bragging rights of being a music major. He had been missing\nclasses for two weeks. I stared at him. He had unkempt black hair and a long\nbeard and wore nothing but an undershirt and salmon-colored boxers. He stared\nback, “What?”\n\nI still stared at him and couldn’t stop myself from smiling.\n\n“What?” he repeated, the smile infecting him as he stated to laugh.\n\n“I’m booored,” I exclaimed loudly.\n\n“Fine, fine, what do you want to do?”\n\n---\n\nAfter half an hour, Moe, Sahar, and another friend, Amy, all joined us in our\ndorm. We were all sitting around in a circle, laughing, and playing Truth or\nDare as we drank Heineken beer and Butlers gin profusely to let loose after yet\nanother long week of classes. Alcohol wasn’t allowed in the apartments, but then\nagain, neither was being *this* loud, and nobody seemed to care all that much\nsince everyone else was just as loud this time of night.\n\n“Alright, alright, so, Sahar,” Amy yelled, not realizing how loud she was,\n“you’re pretty drukk, right? Dr - drunk, I mean drunk.” Sahar nodded in\nresponse.\n\n“Alright, *well*, I want youuuuuu,” she paused and squinted at her as she racked\nher brain, “to stand on your head.”\n\nAshraf and I groaned at the lame dare, but Moe kept silent, drinking his gin. He\nhadn’t taken his eyes off Sahar for most of the night.\n\n“What? What!?” Amy defended her dare, and looked at us, before Sahar immediately\nperformed the handstand in a hurry before someone else can come up with a more\nembarrassing dare. Sahar stumbled after a moment of carrying the weight of her\nbody on her head, and we all chuckled.\n\nMoe shifted his gaze towards the clock, and yelled out, “Oh shit!” He wiped his\nmouth and explained, “sorry guys I have to sleep. Got class early tomorrow.”\n\n“Noooo,” we all pleaded, “staaaay.”   I tugged repeatedly at his shirt.  \n\n“Sorry!”\n\nHe promptly left, and the room was enveloped in silence for a moment, but I was\nup next, and was eager to get the ball rolling again.\n\n“Ashraf,” I ordered, slurring my challenge, “I dare you to walk through the hall\n*naked*!” I began chuckling at the thought.  \n\n“Fuck you,” he shouted back, as he pointed right at my face.\n\n“Do it,” we all insisted, as we began chanting to encourage him. “Do it, do it,\ndo it!”\n\nHe reluctantly got up off the fuzzy blue carpet, walked to the door, opened it,\nand peeked outside, before looking back at us. Quickly, he started stripping as\nwe all cheered at his bravado. Obviously, he had still been wearing his t-shirt\nand underwear, so he hadn’t had much to take off. He took off his tee revealing\nhis hairy back, the envy of gorillas everywhere. When the giant took off his\nboxers, I looked away because I did *not* want to see that. Ashraf hurried out\nthe door and ran from one end of the hall to the other on his tip toes, to avoid\nmaking noise, and we staggered up to watch him.\n\nWhen he came back in, we all gave him a high five after he put his boxers back\non. “I think I’m the clear winner,” Ashraf said calmly in his deep, gravely,\nbellowing voice.\n\n “Definitely, man, after seeing you, we’re all losers,” Sahar joked.\n\nAfter the laughter subsided, I glanced at Ashraf and scratched my chin. “You\nknow, I bet I can make *anyone* do *anything*.”\n\n“How do you figure that?” Amy asked, because of course she did. Amy was smart\nand looked it too. She had long, straight, raven hair, and carefully threaded\neyebrows which adorned very angular eyes. She studied hard, and was pretty shy,\nunlike the rest of us, but she went to school with me and Moe, and we grew\ncloser and closer as the years went on.\n\n“Well, you make a game out of it. People are so quick to do things to impress\neach other, so a game will make anyone want to do anything you dare them to.”\n\n“Bullshit,” Ashraf shouted out as he put his boxers back on. “I just did this\nbecause I wanted to.”\n\n“You wanna bet?”\n\nAfter we all settled down, we sat at the desk and started thinking up a game\nthat would get anyone to do anything as we argued about what the rules should\nbe. Amy took the leading role, rationalizing that we need to ease the readers\ninto more and more complicated challenges. We all agreed we wanted to come up\nwith an ironically edgy theme behind it. In the end, we came up with a simple\nlist of instructions, called the Grey Wolf’s Guide to Liberation, where the more\nchallenges you completed, the more points you were rewarded. The ultimate goal\nwas to “liberate” yourself, to be free from your life’s problems.\n\n1.  Skip your classes and quit your jobs. Life is too short to worry about\n    Capitalism.\n\n2.  The pack of the wolf must be strong. Cut those who have betrayed you, and\n    those who are weak and holding you back, out of your life.\n\n3.  Make love to someone. You are an adult and you must take what you deserve.\n\n4.  Depression and weakness are a plight upon modern man. Get high to avoid\n    facing these trivial matters.\n\n5.  You need to be able to survive; a real wolf does not work. You must steal to\n    show you can do what it takes to survive.\n\n6.  Wolves are powerful creatures. Fight someone to prove your strength.\n\n7.  Kill yourself, for you are now The Grey Wolf, and life cannot get better\n\n“It’s perfect,” I yelled drunkenly, proud of my incredibly stupid list. We all\nlaughed and published it to our college’s internal blog as a joke, believing no\none would really take it seriously. Afterwards, we all continued messing around\nand eating cold pizza until we blacked out.\n\n---\n\nThe next morning, I woke up, massaging my temples through the pain of my\nheadache as my hangover dug into my head. I pushed myself out of my bed and got\nup. Ashraf was still on the couch, his body contorted into the strangest of\npositions. Amy had slept over on the carpet – she was too wasted to go home –\nshe had only started drinking this semester and so was not used to her limits. I\nlooked at my alarm as I rubbed my eyes to clear my vision, and quickly realized\nI was already twenty minutes late to class. I rushed through getting ready, and\nran out, still in the sweatpants and t-shirt that I slept in. By the time I\nreached the Political Science Department, my Arab Studies class had already\nfinished. I bent over and panted heavily, catching my breath. My professor\npushed past me, glaring into my eyes, disappointed in my absence. I stood\nupright and stretched before I realized the hallway was much noisier than usual.\n\nAs students walked through the hallways, something seemed markedly different. I\nsaw two students, one with thick-rimmed glasses, and another with a shirt\nwrinkled where he pulled his it out of his pants. They both ran past me, one\ncarrying a purse, with a girl running after them barefoot with her heels in\nhand. Another girl pushed a guy against the locker and punched his side. I\nwalked further still. In the dark alcove to my left, right by the stairs of the\ndepartment, I saw three pairs of students kissing, at least one I recognized to\nbe cheating. I stopped and stared for a moment, fascinated. They were touching\neach other all over, far too much. One girl, whose neck was being kissed, looked\ntowards the ceiling before shifting her eyes down to me. She pushed her lover\nback a bit. “What the *fuck* are you looking at, creep?” She screeched at me,\nbefore she kissed him back.\n\nOne student turned and saw me, exclaiming, “Guys, guys! It’s the Grey Wolf!”\nStudents left and right stopped their punching, thieving, and kissing to start\nchanting praise. “Noor, this is fucking awesome!” People left and right were\ncheering me on. I had completely forgotten what happened yesterday in my drunken\nhaze, but now, I smirked. People all around were cheering my name, people I had\nrespected, people I had wanted to hang out with, people I had wanted to *be*\nwith, and so many more. Beyond the small crowd around me, I saw more people\nsneering at me. Jealousy, it had to be. But all that was in my head was that I\nhad to see the rest of the group.\n\n I turned and rushed on to look for Moe. We usually meet by the stairs on the\nground floor between classes. I admired the chaotic state of everything as I sat\ndown on the steps. This was my moment, the biggest thing I’ve ever done. I never\nhad great grades like Amy. I was never a great musician like Ashraf. I was never\nan artist like Sahar, nor an athlete like Moe. Maybe my parents would be proud\nnow, I thought to myself jokingly. Politics did indeed seem like my line of\nwork.\n\n“Boo!”\n\nI jumped, startled, but as I turned around, I saw him. “*MOE!* How are you, my\nman,” I fist-bumped him and gave him a hug.\n\nHe hugged back, before slowly asking, confused, “What is going *on* today?”\n\n“It’s the apocalypse,” I joked back, arms out wide bombastically. “Come here,” I\npulled him along with me with my arm around his neck. I started explaining the\ngame to him as we walked to our next class, a Theatre elective we shared.\n\n“That’s insane, dude. I can’t believe you caused all this shit,” he exclaimed,\nsmirking. I nodded, pleased with the attention I was getting, and the effect\nI’ve had on the college. “But how long do you think this is going to last?” Moe\nasked.\n\n“Come on! My fifteen minutes of fame just started, and you’re already wondering\nwhen it’s gonna end,” I chuckled, “just enjoy it while it lasts!”\n\n---\n\nA party was quickly set up for that night, and we all joined. I insisted Moe\ncome with me. Ever since he got to college, he had become a lot more social, and\nloved to party – that’s when he started going by Moe rather than Mohammed. Moe\nand I grew up together. We know everything about each other. We’ve been through\nfights, heartache, and happiness together. He’s my best friend. And now that\nhe’s loosening up I don’t want him to get wound back into his safe zone. He’s\nthe best of us, the smartest, and the kindest. The kind of guy to always have\nyour back, even when you’re having problems. So I want him to be happy - to\nrelax. He warned that his GPA would come crashing down, but he was a straight A\nstudent so I convinced him that he could spare an hour or two. At five to\nmidnight, a hundred students surrounded a bonfire in the middle of the desert.\n\nI carpooled with Moe, Sahar, and Amy, with Amy driving her hand-me-down 2004\ngrey Toyota 4-seater. The asphalt of the road faded long ago, and we drove on\ndirt now. As we approached, still hundreds of meters out, the fire brought light\nto all our faces despite the dark, bringing out our inner flame - our inner\nlife. The red hues bled into thick black smoke which rose into the purple sky.\nThe Grey Wolf called again.\n\nWe got out, surrounded by the mob that flocked to the fire from all directions.\nSeveral students brought drugs of all sorts – hash, joints, and some even had\ncoke - and I don’t mean the drink. Most students participated. I led my group\nthrough the students that didn’t, all the ones that wanted to be a part of the\nparty but not of the debauchery, and mostly just chatted as they had their cokes\n– yes, the drink. When we finally reached the bonfire, we sat on large pillows\nwe brought with us. I tried some but failed to get Moe to join in on the fun. He\ndrank but didn’t want to get into drugs. Besides, he had his mind on other\nthings. He was looking at his phone’s wallpaper – a picture of him with his\nparents, around a decade ago. His relationship with them was always complicated.\nHe loved them, but they were always paranoid, and wanted him home all the time.\nBut now, he missed them. He’s missed them every day. When he noticed me staring,\nhe shut his phone and picked up a piece of *feteer*, a layered pastry covered in\nsugar. I looked around again, and this time my eyes landed on Sahar. She was\nwith Amy, Ashraf, and some other friends but was now staring at Moe.\n\nI leaned over to Moe, and whispered, “hey, Moe? Have you noticed you seem to\nhave a fan?”\n\nHe saw I was looking at Sahar. “Uhm, no I actually didn’t,” Moe mumbled, his\ncheeks blushing red.\n\n“Yeah you have. Haven’t you ever considered talking to her about it?”\n\n“I have. But I don’t know. Would we be good together? Would she--”\n\n“You have to try,” I straightened my back, and yelled, “*the grey wolf demands\nit!”*\n\n“Shut up!” he chuckled, “alright, alright. I’ll talk to her.”\n\nMoe got up and walked towards her. I leaned back into the cushion, smiling as he\nwent up to her. As time went on, they talked, and got touchier and touchier over\ntime. I looked for Amy, but she was preoccupied with taking every joint she\ncould find. All around me I heard moans and yelling and music. A lot of people\nwent topless – either due to the flame or the hormones. When that started\nhappening, a lot of the timid people left. Those that remained passed me by and\npraised me for starting this whole thing. I felt accomplished.\n\n            The bell rang, marking the end of the required writing class. Half\nthe students had not shown up, including Moe and Sahar. I waited for Amy to pick\nher books up.\n\n            “Hey, Noor, there was something I wanted to talk to you about.”\n\n            “Yeah of course, what’s up?”\n\n            She put her hair behind her ear. Knowing her, that meant things were\nserious.\n\n            “Yesterday when I got back from the party, I came back to the\napartment and my laptop was gone.”\n\n            “Shit, Amy, I’m so sorry - did your roomie take it?”\n\n            “No, hers was gone too. But I did find this.” She lifted a note that\nsaid, “Claimed by the Grey Wolf.”\n\n            “Oh no, that’s not mi- “\n\n            “I know it’s not yours. But my point is that this is getting out of\nhand.” She sighed. “Noor, have you noticed how many people are walking around\nwith black eyes, how many people are crying because they had their stuff stolen\nor their hearts broken?”\n\n            “No, I hadn’t really noti-“\n\n            “Of course you haven’t noticed. You’re enjoying this.”\n\n            “I’m not enjoying people being hurt, this is supposed to be fun.”\n\n            Amy turned and stopped me, placing her hand on my chest. “Well,\nwe’re past fun. We need to end this. Look, Noor, I trusted you when I became\nyour friend. I trusted you because I know you’re a good guy. And because I know\nyou’re a good guy I know you didn’t mean any of this. But it’s getting out of\nhand. And *you’re* the only one who can fix it, since you started it. So, fix\nit.”\n\n            She turned around quickly and headed down the hallway. I stared at\nher as she went past. “Amy’s probably just exaggerating,” I told myself. I\nlooked around. “They’re just jealous.”\n\n            I hurried down the corridor. “Right? Nothing is wrong.” I looked to\nmy left and saw a girl, crying to her friend over her boyfriend cheating on her.\nI’ve known her since Freshman year. Well, not known, but she’s been in my\nclasses. She seems nice.\n\n            This *is* wrong. I know it. Don’t fool yourself Noor. I’ll… I’ll\nmake a post about it over the weekend. Just a bit longer.\n\n---\n\nCome Saturday, I was shifting in my bed. Assignments were getting the best of my\nsleep. I was late with two essays – one on gerrymandering and the other a study\non modern political discourse - and my professors were denying my requests for\nextensions, no matter how much I pleaded. The week was still filled with revelry\nas everyone went through their checklist to be the first Grey Wolf, but no one\ncompleted it yet. Nevertheless though, I was proud. My friends were, too. The\nentire school was doing something that we started. Maybe it wasn’t the most\nnoble of legacies, but it was a legacy, nonetheless.\n\nBut there was something else keeping me up. I felt like I had to talk to\nsomeone. I called Moe but got no answer. He always answers. I got up and had\nbreakfast, and called him again, to no avail. I started to get annoyed, until I\nfinally decided to go to his apartment downstairs.\n\nI left my room, holding my phone tightly in my hand, turning it over and over as\nI headed towards the stairs, I never realized how dark the hallway was. The few\nlights that were there were woefully dim. The dark grey-beige limestone tiles\nbarely contrasted the slightly lighter walls. I took the stairs down and lurched\ntowards his tall dark-brown door. The lights flickered in the narrow hallway. I\nreached for the secret key he kept behind his now-dead plant. The leaves lay\naround the cracked, brown stem, with the greyed petals laying around it. I\nshifted to unlock the door, which creaked as I pushed it in.\n\nThe room was pitch dark. The only thing I could see was the translucent glow of\nthe red curtains covering the windows. My eyes slowly adjusted to the light. A\nfigure appeared at the other end of the room, right across from the door. I\nbegan to shake. I dropped the keys and fell to my knees. Oh, God; oh God; oh\nGod. There he was. A rope dug deep into his neck, red across his throat where\nhis capillaries burst, tied to the ceiling. His skin was pale, his eyes bulged\nout, reddened, his mouth agape. What the fuck did you do, Moe? Why, oh, God,\nwhy? I rushed to grab him, pushed away the stool that was kicked over right next\nto him, and lifted his corpse up, hoping there’s a chance he was still alive. I\nlifted and lifted as hard as I could before I eventually stop, unable to catch\nmy breath. My hands clasped his jeans, and I pressed my head against his bare\nchest. I hung my head downwards, and noticed the blood dripping down his wrist.\nI pause and step back slowly. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something\nwritten on the wall in the background. I slowly turn to see a message, smeared\nin his own blood. “I am the Grey Wolf.”\n\n---\n\n**Author's note:** Special thanks to Dr. Gretchen McCullough, Tamima, and Mariam from my Fiction Writing class who helped me with the original version, and Sara Shalaby who helped me with the final version.\n\n---\n\n[Image Source](https://www.pexels.com/photo/close-up-of-snowflakes-on-snow-against-sky-326097/)","featuredImage":{"data":{"attributes":{"url":"/uploads/6_e9e0af5342.jpg"}}},"publishedAt":"2022-04-16T21:11:19.384Z","excerpt":"As the sun set over the buildings ahead of me, I walked through the gardens of our campus, back to our apartments just across the road from the college.

My teeth were gritting. My heart was racing faster than ever. I clenched my fist and looked down to try calm myself. Twenty years old and I still had no idea how to do this. Class had ended five minutes ago, and I was still in my seat. The walls  around me were  alabaster-colored, with beige tiled floors and wooden desks. Shahd and Dina, two of my classmates, were in the row ahead of me. I had overheard them talking towards the end of class and had since been enthralled, pretending to work on my assignment. They were talking about my favorite band, Queen. Shahd was filled with excitement as she talked about her favorite album - *A Night At The Opera*, while Dina played with her hair, dark as night, preparing to get back to her rant about why *News Of The World* was far better.\n\n“Even without *Bohemian Rhapsody*, you have *You’re My Best Friend*, *‘39*, and *Love of My Life*,” Shahd enthused, gesticulating dramatically.\n\nI opened my mouth to agree. I wanted to say how intense *The Prophet’s Song* was, and how *You’re My Best Friend* filled me with happiness. I looked up towards them, thinking  I could finally say it. I waited for my opening. My chance to reply. And when it came - when Shahd finished - I simply shut my mouth.\n\nI picked up my books and bag and walked out of the classroom. I was tormented by a shriek – a cacophony of voices, all mine.\n\n*Nobody wanted to hear my opinion - why would I inject myself like that?*\n\n*They don’t care about me at all.*\n\n*You’re My Best Friend? Please, you have no friends.*\n\nI tried not to listen to myself when I was in these moods, but I was right. I had been going to this university for two years, and still had no one to talk to. Every semester I hoped that I would finally be able to meet someone, anyone at all, and every semester, my hopes would still fade away.\n\nI walked past the gardens, the scent of freshly cut grass filled the air. I saw dozens of students in groups of two, three, and even eight. How could anyone manage that? Talking to not one but *seven* other people? I dared not look at them longingly, dared not hope that someone would say, “I love your dress”, or “I know you from Algebra, right?” I simply stared down. I didn’t want to get my hopes up. I didn’t want to scare them off.\n \nTen minutes later, I reached my dorm room, and let down my bag. I’d hardly gotten any sleep last night. I hoped to get some work done, but instead I just collapsed on to the bed. I stared up at the ceiling and the blankness of the beige textured paint stared back at me. I felt so alone. I turned to my side and pressed my knees to my chest, curling into a ball. I breathed slowly, trying to stifle my tears. My eyes started to feel heavy, and I drifted away.\n \nWhen I opened my eyes again, I found myself staring  into an endless void. Blackness surrounded me, but somehow, I felt just a little bit less lonesome. A chill ran down my spine and the cold of the emptiness seeped into my bones. My entire body was suspended, far from anything that could warm me, far from any feeling whatsoever. I floated forwards. Soon, streaks of light began to pass me by. They started coming out slowly, but soon, the muted colors were flying past me at a million miles an hour. The longer they flew, the longer the rays grew. The colors slowly grew bolder, and my body stiffened in fear. The hues began taking the shape of a bright red silhouette, a girl, far ahead in the distance. As I reached the girl, the outline enveloped me until I saw nothing but the cherry hue. Next a girl of canary-yellow started to come over the horizon, before she promptly encompassed me as well. I went through girls of salmon, violet, and emerald before suddenly, everything stopped.\n\nA dark hallway appeared around me, with doorways on each side. As I walked past them, I saw different dates. The first date seemed familiar - my birthday. I walked past more doors with  varying dates, until I came across an open door, with a piercing white light flooding the corridor. As I approached the door, my skin grew paler, anxious of what I may find. I turned the corner, and saw a small figure, a girl , surrounded by more children, a few meters around her in every direction. All the children were raven-black, on a scarlet matte floor. The child started to walk to the right, towards some of the other boys and girls. A bright white figure soon floated down, her wings supporting her. Soon, she surrounded the girl in the center. As my eyes adjusted to the piercing brightness, I saw a face emerge. I recognized her but could not place her - my mind was far too frantic. A bright blue gemstone on a silver necklace adorned her neck. She smiled down at the child. The girl looked back at me, and I soon realized – she was me, back when I was eight. The gateway slid shut in a fraction of a second, forcing me back with a gust of air.\n\nThere was a pause. Then, a shift in the atmosphere, though I couldn’t say what exactly. It felt…drier. I waited for something to happen, for the pain of remembering something to come back. And then I felt nothing. I felt hollow. And it was worse than any pain I could have possibly imagined. I looked down, crouched, and put my face into my hands. I couldn’t even cry. I heard a whisper, growing louder, and becoming higher in pitch. I felt the pressure increase around me.\n \nAnd then I heard my alarm. I was cold. I cradled myself tighter. I pushed myself up, and slowly shifted out of bed. I looked back at my clock and saw I had only twenty minutes until class, so I quickly got dressed, grabbed something to eat and began to head out. As I picked up  my keys from the doorside dresser, I paused to look at the photograph facing  me.\n\nI picked it up. I hadn’t seen my mom in two months. I missed her terribly, but college work always got the best of me. She looked like me. Dark brown hair, bright hazel eyes, and a round, youthful face. As I ran my fingers gingerly across the black frame, I thought of all the times we shared together. I put down the photo, getting one last grin as I saw her  bright blue lapis lazuli necklace shining at me.\n\nTime to get to class.\n\nAs I walked to the classroom, I started thinking about it again. How she never let me play with the other kids. She always had her reasons, that she was scared I’d get hurt. She missed me. Whatever the reason, I never got to see any of the kids in my grade. Tears welled out my eyes. I wiped them quickly before I walked in.\n\nI pushed through the door gently, peering inside. I had been rushing to class, so I was four minutes early. The girls, Shahd and Dina were the only ones there already. The sunlight streamed through the windows, tinting the class orange. I walked past them quietly. “Morning,” Shahd said to me, and I anxiously smiled back subtly out of the side of my mouth. I put my backpack on my desk behind them. Dina peered at me before looking back at Shahd, and began talking about yesterday’s assignments.\n\nI unpacked my bag and began doodling in my notebook, sketching the base of a head, to take my mind off my revelation. As I started to put in the eyes and iris, a shadow covered my drawing.\n\n“That’s pretty good,” Dina said. She grinned at me widely with a sparkle in her green eyes.\n\nI looked up slowly and gulped. I nodded gratefully, and was going to just look back down, but I felt I had to say something more. She was admiring my work.\n\n*What if she hates my voice?*\n\n*What if she is just teasing me and hates the drawing?*\n\n*What if she’s pitying me and doesn’t actually care?*\n\nI close my eyes and sigh. “Thank you,” I reply softly, “It’s going to be Alex Turner.” Her eyes brightened up even more, shining like a pair of emeralds, clearly a fan of Alex. I put down my pencil. “I’m Nada by the way.”\n\n---\n\n**Author's note:** Lots of thanks to the wonderful Amina Abdel-Halim for editing this story, originally published in the AUC Times.\n\n---\n\n[Image Source](https://www.pexels.com/photo/person-wearing-blue-hoodie-near-body-of-water-433142/)","featuredImage":{"data":{"attributes":{"url":"/uploads/5_5c45882989.jpg"}}},"publishedAt":"2022-04-16T21:10:55.998Z","excerpt":"My hands tapped against my pants.

Dina sat on a couch by the window, stiff, with her arms to her sides, clenching the fabric of the couch. She’d been sitting there since she got home from work half an hour ago, now staring intently at the clock in her living room. She had two minutes. She broke her gaze, and began to look around the room, trying to occupy herself in her last few moments. Dina turned to a vase on her windowsill, noticing she’d have to change the water of the flower that occupied it. She picked it up carefully, delicately, and took it to her kitchen. After she dumped the water in the vase, she started filling it again while she gingerly checked the rose, admiring the soft crimson petals, which wrapped around themselves gracefully. She raised it up to her nose and smelled it, admiring the refreshing aroma. She began to smile to herself.\n\nShe stared out her kitchen window, as the light highlighted her small frame. A woman in her late twenties, Dina had long brown hair, soft rosy cheeks, and glowing hazel eyes. She was vaguely aware that she was pretty: which people told her a lot when she was younger. She was popular in highschool, and successful in college and in her early career, owing to her  intelligence and charisma. Now, her concept beauty was ephemeral, no matter what people said. She did not think much of herself in any way. But as she stood there holding onto the rose, she felt somewhat content. Like her, the flower was beautiful, though ignorant of it. Like her, the flower was small. Like her, the flower was gentle.\n\nSuddenly, the door slammed, catching her attention. He was here. She quickly put the rose back in the vase, turned off the water and rushed to the door. There stood Adham, tall and handsome, with a dark, trimmed beard and even darker, curly hair. He turned to look at his girlfriend and smiled warmly. Although his bright blue eyes pierced her, they had not matched his smile—far too relaxed. He went up to her and held her warmly, his hand caressing her side. Dina shifted uncomfortably, but subtly. \n\n“I missed you so much,” he announced, breaking the embrace. “How are you, honey?” She sighed and kissed him.\n\nOver dinner, Adham was talking about his colleagues - about their hilarious jokes and sad stories. Dina looked into his eyes as he spoke, smiling at the protectiveness and care for his friends. As he finished his tale, he insisted upon knowing about her day. Dina’s eyes lit up as she began talking about the children she had taught, who all got together without her knowing to get her a nice mug as a gift.\n\n“That’s nice,” he smirked, “I’m proud of you.”\n\n“Thank you,” she grinned back.\n\n“How did you get back in time to make lunch though? The bus usually arrives late.”\n\n“I came home with Z-.” Dina cought her tongue and slowly swallowed her words. She regretted opening her mouth. \n\n“With whom?” Adham asked, raising one eyebrow inquisitively.\n\n“Ziad.” She already knew the weight of what she said..\n\nHe clenched his fist around his fork and grit his teeth together as he swallowed his food.\n\n“I told you not to spend time with the guys at work.” He hissed as he continued cutting his steak.\n\nDina grabbed her own arm and began stroking it nervously. She didn’t know what to do - whether to explain herself, or to stay silent. She gulped again. “I – I can’t ignore all the men around me,” she stuttered.\n\n“Yes, you can. I don’t care how, I don’t trust you around men,” he began cutting quicker and more forcefully into the meat.\n\n“There’s dozens of people there, I can’t just leave th-“\n\n“Yes, you can. I don’t want my girlfriend being a slut. Now drop the fucking subject or else.”\n\nShe paused. The silence filled the room, the only sound coming from Adham’s knife, which was cutting randomly into his steak all over, as he tried to let out his anger. Dina stared at her glass of water.\n\n“Or… Or else what?” she asked. She tried to put on a straight face, but her feet were tapping anxiously but silently under the table.\n\nHe dropped his silverware and grasped the table, which screeched along the floor by the force of his anger. “Excuse me?” he snarled back at her.\n\n“Adham, I can’t handle this. If you keep this up,” she paused and sighed. She looked into his eyes. She fought against herself. Her mind was tearing itself apart. She loved him – she knew she did – but just because you love someone doesn’t mean you belong with them. She continued: “If you keep this up, I’m going to have to kick you out.” Her brows furrowed as menacingly as she could make them, but her gentle features betrayed her.\n\nAdham tossed the table aside, spilling all the food and breaking the plates in a cacophony of sound. He rushed over to her and in a moment, he was standing above her. Dina flinched but kept her composure, her hands surreptitiously gripping the sides of the chair in fear.\n\n“Say that again.” He raised his hand menacingly.\n\nDina pushed her chair back and folded her arms, and she slowly gave the order: “Get out.”\n\nAdham noticed she was trembling, and smirked. “You don’t want me gone.”\n\n“No, I don’t.” She looked down at her feet, before she worked up the courage to continue, and looked him in the eye. “But I need you to leave anyways.”\n\nHis smirk turned sour. He stared at her and lifted his hand, and she closed her eyes, terrified. Nothing happened. Her eyes were closed for what felt like an eternity, but a moment later, she eased them open, and across from her, the door was left ajar as she caught a peek of him storming out in rage. She knew he didn’t want to hurt her. He was a cruel man, though in his own, disturbed way, he did love her. But that excused nothing. That did not make up for the years of emotional pain she felt. That did not mean she was at all free when they were together. But he was gone — for now.\n\nDina let out a sigh. She began shaking uncontrollably, knowing this was just the beginning of the fight to get out of this hell. Dina noticed her hand was clenched, ready to fight back if need be. She walked nervously into the kitchen, and took a glass from her brown oak shelves, and filled it in her sink. As she took a sip and gulped down the water, before openning her eyes. Shifted her glance to the red rose which absorbed her attention. Dina put down her glass and picked up the rose, and sniffing it again and relaxed her. She felt something on her fingers though, and opened her eyes, noticing blood flowing down her finger. Then she remembered. All roses have thorns.\n\n---\n\n**Author's note:** I wrote this story to talk about domestic abuse, a huge problem not only in Egypt but all over the world. I wanted to write specifically about domestic abuse when you love your partner though. This happens constantly and is extremely dangerous because victims tend to rationalize their abusers' violence.

Wagging her tail, she let out her tongue, panting, excited to see her family. She quickly got up to lick her dad, who then attached a leash. They walked through the piles of bills and warning notices, around their television stand, and left the house, getting into her dad’s red flat-back truck. \n\nShe had no idea where they were going, but usually loved going out. She jumped up from her chair next to dad, up to the window, letting the cool air blow against his face. She sniffed the wonderful smell of the oak trees and cornfields that pass them by. She turned and look at dad lovingly. He had a sad look on his face as he stared forward, but when he looked back at her, he smiled, before he looked back ahead. Soon, the car came to a halt and they got out at a large building. At first, Patchi worried they were at a vet. But that wasn’t it. Dad walked in and talked to a strange man sternly, a tear falling down his eye, and Patchi, not understanding, looked up confused. Soon, dad pat her head, took her face in his hands and kissed her snout. But then got up and walked past her. She barked, and tugged, but couldn’t move. She turned back, seeing the strange man holding her leash. She tried the best she could to run. Soon, Patchi gave in and fell down. Tears in her eyes, she put her snout down to the ground, closing her eyes.\n\nPatchi’s was there for what felt like forever. Locked in a dry, cold cage, she was fed tasteless dry food. The bars of the cage were scratched all over, not only from her own claw marks, but from the claws of hundreds of other dogs, all wanting an escape from their prison. Patchi sat, tail curled around herself, hiding a scar she got when the other dogs met her, which stretches long across her back leg, the blood flaked in the fur around it.. Soon she heard a rustle, and looked up, scared. And then she heard a familiar voice. She looked up, and saw dad again. Dad hugged and kissed her, and Patchi, unabashedly happy. Dad hugged her. “I’m so sorry. This was all a mistake. And I promise you, it’ll never happen again.” Patchi didn’t understand, but licked his face anyways. Dad hugged Patchi, and picked her up. “Let’s go home,” he said, “there’s some treats just waiting for you.” \n    \n Soon, they arrived back home. Patchi, overexerted from the day’s trials, laid down on the floor. Dad kissed Patchi’s snout again, gave her a treat, and cuddled her. They laid there for an eternity, where the television used to be. The boxes gone, the couch gone, it was just the two, together, as it should be.\n\n---\n\n[Image Source](https://www.pexels.com/photo/light-golden-retriever-puppy-close-up-photography-159541/)","featuredImage":{"data":{"attributes":{"url":"/uploads/3_add4529af0.jpg"}}},"publishedAt":"2022-04-16T21:10:02.429Z","excerpt":"Darkness broke as Patchi’s eyes flutter open slowly, taking in the warm hues of the room around her as she feels a hand rub her back.

Special thanks to Amina Abdel Halim for editing this piece.\n\n---\n\nClick clack. The sounds of fingers hitting keys. Tick tock. The noise of gears\ntwisting and churning at the center of a nearby clock. Bla bla. The utterances\nof people speaking all around me. I only started working for this company half a\nweek ago, yet, I see the paradoxes clearly. The silence was deafening. An\noppressive cacophony of empty noises filled the large office, echoing and\nreverbing. You don’t notice it when you arrive, but after the first hour, the\nracket is enough to drive a man crazy. Then there was the office itself. The\nworkplace was filled mostly with men in white or blue shirts. The walls were\nwhite. The ceilings were white. The floor was a light steel blue. So many light\ncolors can be serene, but here, it merely exaggerated whatever colors did not\nconform to the desaturated hues. Finally, there was the smell. The smell of\nnothing. The office was cleaned daily, so that every inch of it was sterile of\nany imperfection, both in terms of dirt and smell. Every so often, the aroma of\na donut, the odor of coffee, or the whiff of perfume filled the space around me.\nIt woke me up from my passivity, only to come crashing down as soon as the air\nwas clear.\n\n*I can’t do this. I can’t do this. I can’t do this.* I’ve been studying for\nyears to live my life - to do something – and now I’m here. I turn to look at\nthe framed photo on my desk. There I am. Sitting with her laying on a bench, her\nhead on my lap. The park we’re in is just so vibrantly green it radiates out to\nme. Our bright smiles pierce through the photo and capture my attention. The\nglint in our eyes maintains it. God, I miss her. God, I miss those times. I\nremember how her Golden Retriever used to drag me all over to meet the other\ndogs. How we used to pick strawberries from the bushes, and flowers to put in\nher hair. I move my hand to my wrist, to the brown lace and white beads of the\nbracelet tucked beneath my shirt cuff, the one she gave me all those years ago.\n\n“Hey, you!” The shrieking voice breaks my focus, and my head swivels swiftly to\nlook at the source of the exclamation. A face hovers inches away from my own.\nThe bold, black glasses are the first to catch my attention. Then the short,\ncarefully trimmed hair, the clean-shaven face; the skinny, weak jawline, and the\nbright red power tie all slowly bring me to recognize him: one of the dozens of\nmiddle-managers roaming the office. I don’t know the man, he could be faceless,\nbut they all look so alike that he’s still instantly recognizable.\n\n“What the hell are you doing?” I stare despondently into his eyes, then shift to\nstaring at his lips. I don’t need to know what he’s saying; I know why he’s\nhere. I just mumble in agreement and look back to the bright blue fluorescence\nof the monitor. To excel. You know you’re not meant to be where you are when you\nstare at *fucking* excel all day.\n\nWork stretches on for hours and hours. I get up and go to the kitchen for my own\ncup of coffee. I start circling the rim of my mug as I wait for the pot to boil.\nBut there, a flash of green draws my eyes. I walk to the window, and see a park\nlit brightly, of amber and verdant leaves dancing in the sun. Tall, brown pine\ntrees tower above children chasing each other, and dogs chase the children. I\npress my hands close against the glass as I lean forward, looking down. I let\nthe vision consume me. Upon closer inspection, I see a girl of around 10,\nstaring up at me. Her brown pigtails fly in the wind as she sits on the grass.\nShe starts to smile, and wave. After a second, I realize she means me. The\ncorners of my mouth pull back into a smile. She looks for a moment more before\nshe turns away – must have been called back by her mom.\n\nAs she leaves, the reflection starts to catch my eye. The whiteness. The blues.\nI clench my fist and sigh before turning, grabbing my coffee, and heading to my\ndesk. As I approach the cubicle, the man from before catches me again. With the\nsame disdain, the same anger, simply using his power to bark orders at whoever\nhe can. A minute passes by of him yelling. I can’t take it. I close my eyes.\n“Look at me when I’m talking to you, *dumbass*!”\n\nI can’t take it.\n\nMy fist clenches around the handle of the mug. I open my eyes. I swiftly hand\nhim the mug and push past him. “Get back here. I’m not done with you!”\n\nI have my targets set. The door at the far end of the office. I’m **fucking**\ndone.\n\nMy colleagues get up and start to look at me. “Hey, are you okay?”\n\nThey start to whisper amongst themselves as the manager’s screeching rises.\n\nI push past them all. I push past it all. And I reach the handle.\n\nI twist it.\n\n*And.*\n\n*I’m free.*\n\n\n---\n\n[Image Source](https://www.pexels.com/photo/light-road-landscape-nature-35600/)\n","featuredImage":{"data":{"attributes":{"url":"/uploads/2_3efc9fe665.jpg"}}},"publishedAt":"2022-04-16T21:09:36.102Z","excerpt":"Click clack.

I'm Karim Abdel Hamid, a Computer Engineering student at the American Univerity in Cairo. I'm currently working on my game engine, [Grindstone](/grindstone.htm).

I love games because it's both a science, and an art, and I love engine development specifically because it feels like I have the power to do anything at my fingertips! Computer graphics is such a deep and immersive topic that I could talk about it for days on end, and it really makes you appreciate the beauty in life. Game engines are also a lot more than that though, they're a huge software engineering project, and one that I find very intriguing!\n\nI also love making websites! Both front-end and back-end. I really enjoy animation in UX/UI, and adding social functions to my websites (this doesn't count, since it's all frameworks).\n\nIn my personal life, I love to draw, cook, play the guitar, write stories, and hang out with my friends, family, and dog, Chewy! I have a big love of music, video games, and film, and I try to read and watch tv shows when I get a chance to (most of my reading now is computer graphics academia related though).\n\n## Why follow the blog?\nIn this blog, I plan to talk about:\n * Grindstone's progress updates, including feature highlights\n * Oak.js progress updates\n * Various other projects\n * Computer Graphics Tutorials\n * Game Engine Tutorials\n * Whatever else is on my mind\n\nI know not everyone will be interested in everything so you can search by category, but hopefully there's enough to interest everyone!\n\nI hope you enjoy whatever is to come!
