Hey there, and welcome to my first blog post! I'm Karim Abdel Hamid, a Computer Engineering student at the American Univerity in Cairo. I'm currently working on my game engine, [Grindstone](/grindstone.htm). I'm also co-developing [Oak.js](https://donn.github.io/Oak.js/) an web-based assembler, disassembler and simulator for RISC-V and MIPS. 

I hope to open my own game development studio way in the future. I love games because it's both a science, and an art, and I love engine development specifically because it feels like I have the power to do anything at my fingertips! Computer graphics is such a deep and immersive topic that I could talk about it for days on end, and it really makes you appreciate the beauty in life. Game engines are also a lot more than that though, they're a huge software engineering project, and one that I find very intriguing!

I also love making websites! Both front-end and back-end. I really enjoy animation in UX/UI, and adding social functions to my websites (this doesn't count, since it's all frameworks).

In my personal life, I love to draw, cook, play the guitar, write stories, and hang out with my friends, family, and dog, Chewy! I have a big love of music, video games, and film, and I try to read and watch tv shows when I get a chance to (most of my reading now is computer graphics academia related though).

## Why follow the blog?
In this blog, I plan to talk about:
 * Grindstone's progress updates, including feature highlights
 * Oak.js progress updates
 * Various other projects
 * Computer Graphics Tutorials
 * Game Engine Tutorials
 * Whatever else is on my mind

I know not everything is interested in everything so you can search by category, but hopefully there's enough to interest everyone!

I hope you enjoy whatever is to come! Let the adventure begin! ALLONS-Y!
