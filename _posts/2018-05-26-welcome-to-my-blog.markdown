Hey there, and welcome to my first blog post! I'm Karim Abdel Hamid, a Computer Engineering student at the American Univerity in Cairo. I'm currently working on my game engine, [Grindstone](/grindstone.htm). I'm also co-developing [Oak.js](https://donn.github.io/Oak.js/) an web-based assembler, disassembler and simulator for RISC-V and MIPS. 

In this blog, I plan to talk about:
 * Grindstone's progress updates, including feature highlights
 * Oak.js progress updates
 * Various other projects
 * Computer Graphics Tutorials
 * Game Engine Tutorials
 * Whatever else is on my mind

I know not everything is interested in everything so you can search by category.
