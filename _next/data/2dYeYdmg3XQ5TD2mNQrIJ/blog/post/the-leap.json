Special thanks to Amina Abdel Halim for editing this piece.\n\n---\n\nClick clack. The sounds of fingers hitting keys. Tick tock. The noise of gears\ntwisting and churning at the center of a nearby clock. Bla bla. The utterances\nof people speaking all around me. I only started working for this company half a\nweek ago, yet, I see the paradoxes clearly. The silence was deafening. An\noppressive cacophony of empty noises filled the large office, echoing and\nreverbing. You don’t notice it when you arrive, but after the first hour, the\nracket is enough to drive a man crazy. Then there was the office itself. The\nworkplace was filled mostly with men in white or blue shirts. The walls were\nwhite. The ceilings were white. The floor was a light steel blue. So many light\ncolors can be serene, but here, it merely exaggerated whatever colors did not\nconform to the desaturated hues. Finally, there was the smell. The smell of\nnothing. The office was cleaned daily, so that every inch of it was sterile of\nany imperfection, both in terms of dirt and smell. Every so often, the aroma of\na donut, the odor of coffee, or the whiff of perfume filled the space around me.\nIt woke me up from my passivity, only to come crashing down as soon as the air\nwas clear.\n\n*I can’t do this. I can’t do this. I can’t do this.* I’ve been studying for\nyears to live my life - to do something – and now I’m here. I turn to look at\nthe framed photo on my desk. There I am. Sitting with her laying on a bench, her\nhead on my lap. The park we’re in is just so vibrantly green it radiates out to\nme. Our bright smiles pierce through the photo and capture my attention. The\nglint in our eyes maintains it. God, I miss her. God, I miss those times. I\nremember how her Golden Retriever used to drag me all over to meet the other\ndogs. How we used to pick strawberries from the bushes, and flowers to put in\nher hair. I move my hand to my wrist, to the brown lace and white beads of the\nbracelet tucked beneath my shirt cuff, the one she gave me all those years ago.\n\n“Hey, you!” The shrieking voice breaks my focus, and my head swivels swiftly to\nlook at the source of the exclamation. A face hovers inches away from my own.\nThe bold, black glasses are the first to catch my attention. Then the short,\ncarefully trimmed hair, the clean-shaven face; the skinny, weak jawline, and the\nbright red power tie all slowly bring me to recognize him: one of the dozens of\nmiddle-managers roaming the office. I don’t know the man, he could be faceless,\nbut they all look so alike that he’s still instantly recognizable.\n\n“What the hell are you doing?” I stare despondently into his eyes, then shift to\nstaring at his lips. I don’t need to know what he’s saying; I know why he’s\nhere. I just mumble in agreement and look back to the bright blue fluorescence\nof the monitor. To excel. You know you’re not meant to be where you are when you\nstare at *fucking* excel all day.\n\nWork stretches on for hours and hours. I get up and go to the kitchen for my own\ncup of coffee. I start circling the rim of my mug as I wait for the pot to boil.\nBut there, a flash of green draws my eyes. I walk to the window, and see a park\nlit brightly, of amber and verdant leaves dancing in the sun. Tall, brown pine\ntrees tower above children chasing each other, and dogs chase the children. I\npress my hands close against the glass as I lean forward, looking down. I let\nthe vision consume me. Upon closer inspection, I see a girl of around 10,\nstaring up at me. Her brown pigtails fly in the wind as she sits on the grass.\nShe starts to smile, and wave. After a second, I realize she means me. The\ncorners of my mouth pull back into a smile. She looks for a moment more before\nshe turns away – must have been called back by her mom.\n\nAs she leaves, the reflection starts to catch my eye. The whiteness. The blues.\nI clench my fist and sigh before turning, grabbing my coffee, and heading to my\ndesk. As I approach the cubicle, the man from before catches me again. With the\nsame disdain, the same anger, simply using his power to bark orders at whoever\nhe can. A minute passes by of him yelling. I can’t take it. I close my eyes.\n“Look at me when I’m talking to you, *dumbass*!”\n\nI can’t take it.\n\nMy fist clenches around the handle of the mug. I open my eyes. I swiftly hand\nhim the mug and push past him. “Get back here. I’m not done with you!”\n\nI have my targets set. The door at the far end of the office. I’m **fucking**\ndone.\n\nMy colleagues get up and start to look at me. “Hey, are you okay?”\n\nThey start to whisper amongst themselves as the manager’s screeching rises.\n\nI push past them all. I push past it all. And I reach the handle.\n\nI twist it.\n\n*And.*\n\n*I’m free.*\n\n\n---\n\n[Image Source](https://www.pexels.com/photo/light-road-landscape-nature-35600/)\n","featuredImage":{"data":{"attributes":{"url":"/uploads/2_3efc9fe665.jpg"}}},"publishedAt":"2022-04-16T21:09:36.102Z","excerpt":"Click clack.
