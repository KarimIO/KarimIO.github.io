{"pageProps":{"post":{"data":[{"id":"1","attributes":{"title":"Welcome to my Blog!","content":"Hey there, and welcome to my first blog post! I'm Karim Abdel Hamid, a Computer Engineering student at the American Univerity in Cairo. I'm currently working on my game engine, [Grindstone](/grindstone.htm). I'm also co-developing [Oak.js](https://donn.github.io/Oak.js/) an web-based assembler, disassembler and simulator for RISC-V and MIPS. \n\nI hope to open my own game development studio way in the future. I love games because it's both a science, and an art, and I love engine development specifically because it feels like I have the power to do anything at my fingertips! Computer graphics is such a deep and immersive topic that I could talk about it for days on end, and it really makes you appreciate the beauty in life. Game engines are also a lot more than that though, they're a huge software engineering project, and one that I find very intriguing!\n\nI also love making websites! Both front-end and back-end. I really enjoy animation in UX/UI, and adding social functions to my websites (this doesn't count, since it's all frameworks).\n\nIn my personal life, I love to draw, cook, play the guitar, write stories, and hang out with my friends, family, and dog, Chewy! I have a big love of music, video games, and film, and I try to read and watch tv shows when I get a chance to (most of my reading now is computer graphics academia related though).\n\n## Why follow the blog?\nIn this blog, I plan to talk about:\n * Grindstone's progress updates, including feature highlights\n * Oak.js progress updates\n * Various other projects\n * Computer Graphics Tutorials\n * Game Engine Tutorials\n * Whatever else is on my mind\n\nI know not everyone will be interested in everything so you can search by category, but hopefully there's enough to interest everyone!\n\nI hope you enjoy whatever is to come! Let the adventure begin! ALLONS-Y!\n","featuredImage":{"data":{"attributes":{"url":"/uploads/1_c385de610a.png"}}},"publishedAt":"2022-04-16T21:09:04.082Z","excerpt":"Hey there, and welcome to my first blog post!
