        <h1><img src="images/grindstone.svg" alt="Grindstone Game Engine" /></h1>
        <p>In-progress game engine developed by Karim Abdel Hamid. Progress started in May 2014, and has been reworked multiple times as I've learned more.</p>
        
        <h2>System Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Extensible Cross-Platform system with support for Linux, Windows, with plans to support Mac, Mobile, and PS/Xbox</li>
            <li>Multiple rendering APIs supported with Graphics abstraction layer. Currently OpenGL and Vulkan</li>
            <li>Flexible Entity Component System allows for better extensibility, performance, and multithreading</li>
            <li>Code with either the C++ native programming or our C# Scripting system</li>
            <li>Reflection system exposes classes to the editor, save system, and networking</li>
            <li>Integration with bullet physics</li>
            <li>Frustum culling</li>
            <li>Quick scene loading</li>
            <li>Logging and Profiling systems</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rendering</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Material and shader system allow for developers to easily create new materials in a cross platform way that hooks up to native systems</li>
            <li>Viewport and camera systems allow for various different types of cameras to show the world both in game and in many times in editor</li>
            <li>Deferred rendering to increase rendering performance</li>
            <li>Post processing pipeline that includes Tonemapping, Bloom, SSAO, Automatic Exposure Adjustment, Color Grading, and more</li>
            <li>Shadow mapping</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Editor</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently in the process of revamping the editor to be its own executable</li>
            <li>Immediate-mode GUI for level editor, which includes an asset browser, component inspector, scene graph viewer, and multiple viewports</li>
            <li>Some procedural editing features (perlin noise terrain, hydraulic weathering of terrain for improved realism)</li>
            <li>Cubemap building</li>
            <li>Image, Material, and Model conversion to compressed formats, both native and otherwise</li>
            <li>Work on adding more tools such as material editor</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Grindstone will be released for free for those developing free games, and licensable for others, at an undecided date.</p>
